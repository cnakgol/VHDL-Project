# VHDL-Project
This is a basic car racing game written with VHDL.
First, you should install the program on FPGA board via Adept. Then, you should connect the VGA driver of your monitor to the FPGA board. 
Itâ€™s that simple: You are ready to play! 
There are 3 buttons for your use. The button at the center (BNTS) is to reset the game. 
The buttons on the left (BTNL) and on the right (BTNR) is for motion. You can move the white car by using these buttons. 
The aim of this game is to pass as many red cars as you can without any crash. 
When you crash a car, the game is over and start again for a new round. 
A counter on the FPGA board counts the cars you pass up to 63. After 63, you win: Congratulations!
